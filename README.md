#Buidling a Dungeon Text Adventure

Project from Beginning Ruby book

> In this section, you’re going to implement a mini text adventure/virtual dungeon. Text adventures were popular in
the 1980s, but have fallen out of favor with modern gamers seeking graphical thrills. They’re perfect playgrounds for
 experimenting with classes and objects, though, as replicating the real world in a virtual form requires a complete
  understanding of mapping real-world concepts into classes.

##Dungeon Consepts

* Dungeon: You need a general class that encapsulates the entire concept of the dungeon game.

* Player: The player provides the link between the dungeon and you. All experience of the dungeon comes through the
player. The player can move between rooms in the dungeon.

* Rooms: The rooms of the dungeon are the locations that the player can navigate between. These will be linked
together in multiple ways (doors to the north, west, east, and south, for example) and have descriptions.
